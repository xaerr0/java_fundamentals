 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
            SELECT * FROM students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
             SELECT first_name, last_name
             FROM teachers
             WHERE SUBJECT = 'math'

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
             SELECT CONCAT (s.last_name, ', ', s.first_name) AS student_full_name,
             CONCAT (t.last_name, ', ', t.first_name) AS teacher_full_name, t.subject
             FROM students s
             JOIN teachers_students ts
             ON s.id = ts.student_id
             JOIN teachers t
             ON ts.teacher_id = t.id
             where t.id = 2;


 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
             SELECT CONCAT (s.last_name, ', ', s.first_name) AS student_full_name,
             CONCAT (t.last_name, ', ', t.first_name) AS teacher_full_name, t.subject
             FROM students s
             JOIN teachers_students ts
             ON s.id = ts.student_id
             JOIN teachers t
             ON ts.teacher_id = t.id
             where subject = 'math'



 *          e. update a record in the student table
             UPDATE students
             SET first_name = 'matt', last_name = 'tress', email = 'mattress@codingnomads.co'
             WHERE id = '5';

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
            INSERT INTO teachers (id, first_name, last_name, subject)
            VALUES ('9', 'don', 'key', 'tree climbing');
 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
            DONE!
